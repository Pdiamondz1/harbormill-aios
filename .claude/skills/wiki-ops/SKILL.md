# Wiki Operations

This skill manages the knowledge wiki at `docs/wiki/`. Read the full schema
at `docs/KNOWLEDGE_WIKI.md` before proceeding.

## Operations

### `/wiki-ops ingest <source>`

Ingest a raw source into structured wiki pages.

**Steps:**
1. Read the raw source completely. If the user said "ingest X", find the
   file matching X in the project.
2. Discuss 3-5 key takeaways with the user. What's interesting? What's
   new? What contradicts existing wiki knowledge?
3. Create a source summary page in `docs/wiki/sources/` with frontmatter:
   `type: source`, one-paragraph summary, key claims, notable quotes.
4. Create or update entity pages in `docs/wiki/entities/` for any
   integrations, services, or systems mentioned significantly (Supabase,
   Anthropic chat, the report-ingest seam, Aria, etc.).
5. Create or update concept pages in `docs/wiki/concepts/` for any
   architectural patterns, business concepts, or frameworks discussed
   (white-label architecture, access model, AI tool registry, etc.).
6. Update `[[cross-references]]` — add See Also links across all touched
   pages. Use `[[Display Name]]` syntax.
7. Update `docs/wiki/index.md` — add new entries, keep alphabetically
   sorted within each section. Format: `- [[Display Name]](path) — summary`
8. Append to `docs/wiki/log.md`:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title
   Description of what was ingested.
   Pages created: [[Page 1]], [[Page 2]]
   Pages updated: [[Page 3]]
   ```

**Rules:**
- Never modify files in `docs/wiki/raw/`. Sources are immutable.
- Use kebab-case for filenames: `report-ingest-seam.md`, not `Report Ingest Seam.md`.
- When new info contradicts an existing page, flag the contradiction
  explicitly in the page — never silently overwrite.
- Prefer updating existing pages over creating new ones. Check `index.md`
  for existing pages before creating a new one.

### `/wiki-ops query <question>`

Answer a question using the wiki as the primary knowledge source.

**Steps:**
1. Read `docs/wiki/index.md` to identify relevant pages.
2. Read those pages. Follow `[[wikilinks]]` for related context.
   **Limits:** max 2 levels of link-following, max 5 pages total.
3. Synthesize an answer with inline citations: `([[Page Name]])`.
4. If the answer contains substantial synthesis worth preserving, offer
   to file it as an analysis page in `docs/wiki/analyses/`.
5. If the wiki lacks information, say so and suggest what sources might
   fill the gap.

Answer from the wiki first. Only go to raw sources, the codebase, or
`CLAUDE.md` if the wiki doesn't have enough detail.

### `/wiki-ops lint`

Health check on the wiki. Run on request or suggest every ~20 ingestions.

**Check for:**
- **Contradictions** between pages (flag with specific quotes from each)
- **Stale claims** superseded by newer sources
- **Orphan pages** with no inbound `[[wikilinks]]` from other pages
- **Missing pages** — concepts mentioned in `[[wikilinks]]` that don't
  have their own page yet
- **Missing cross-references** between pages that cover related topics
- **Data gaps** — topics where only one source exists or coverage is thin
- **Index completeness** — pages that exist on disk but aren't in `index.md`

**Output:** A structured report with numbered findings and suggested fixes.
Apply fixes only with user approval.

### Session-End Extract

At the end of a working session, when the user asks to update the wiki:

1. Write a structured session extract to
   `docs/wiki/raw/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` capturing:
   - What was built or fixed
   - Key decisions made and why
   - Bugs discovered and how they were resolved
   - Patterns or learnings worth preserving
2. Ingest the extract following the standard 8-step ingest flow above.

## Pairs with

- The **autoresearch** skill — an autonomous loop (built on the built-in
  `deep-research` harness) that researches gaps and files verified pages through
  this skill's ingest flow.
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — the canonical project identity the wiki mirrors
  at `docs/wiki/sources/project-context.md`.
